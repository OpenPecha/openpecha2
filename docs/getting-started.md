## 3. Troubleshooting

When using this package, it's beneficial to be aware of the following key points:


- ***üåêEnsure a Stable Internet Connection:***If you haven't specified a custom path for
downloading a pecha, it will be automatically downloaded and stored in a designated
directory on your local machine (refer to config.py). If the pecha containing the
required annotation isn't present in the directory, it will be fetched from the GitHub
 repository.

- ***üìÅPecha ID you provid is valid Format:***The pecha ID you provide must correspond
to one available in the GitHub repository.

- ***üìÅVerify Proper Format of Pecha Content Attributes:***Data validation is performed
using the pydantic module to ensure the pecha content is in the correct format. If the
 content doesn't meet the format criteria, such as in an OPF file where the text offset
  start is less than the end, an error will occur.

For additional troubleshooting, refer to the (exceptions.py) file.
